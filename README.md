# Nonlinear Dynamics

The aim of this repository is to solve every exercise from the book _Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, 2ed_ by Stephen Strogatz.

In particular, the real purpose is to generate a set of Julia Notebooks that can be used to practice and learn Dynamical Systems while using the
famous book by Strogatz.

The motivation for this is that I myself want to learn Dynamical Systems as a hobby, and this repository is the evidence of that journey
down the rabbit hole that is the amazing world of Dynamical Systems.

Everything will be written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

## A Note on Julia libraries

Although the purpose of this repository is to learn Dynamical Systems, numerical methods will be compulsory while traversing the exercises and its
solutions. The basic numerical methods are _integration schemes_ for solving ordinary differential equations, and some libraries for plotting, of course.

While this is the basic and _natural_ approach, it is important to note that the library [DynamicalSystems.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DynamicalSystems.jl)
exists and it's a fantastic tool for Dynamical Systems in general, but I will _not_ be using it in this repository just to keep the original purpose of this repository
true to its value, but everyone is welcome to try and experiment with it.
