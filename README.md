# Nonlinear Dynamics

The aim of this repository is to solve every exercise from the book _Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, 2ed_ by Stephen Strogatz.

In particular, the real purpose is to generate a set of Julia Notebooks that can be used to practice and learn Dynamical Systems.

The motivation for this is that I myself want to learn Dynamical Systems as a hobby, and this repository is the evidence of that journey
down to rabbit hole.

Everything will be written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).
